This document describes what the procedure for testing a newly soldered lidar board should be.

1 - Ensure nothing is connected to the board (no Teensy, or peripherals) before applying power.

2 - Apply power and test reverse polarity protection. Check that power LED lights up and test both regulators.

3 - Verify power is distributed properly to all peripherals.

3 - Add Teensy board, verify it turns on properly and execute blink program. 

4 - Very correct motor MOS function either using a multimeter or a pump.

5 - Add Lidar and verify previously written Lidar core for Neato lidar.

6 - Add ONE Neopixel to test the functions of the transceiver and use simple test code using the non blocking simpler teensy library.
