This document describes what the procedure for testing a newly soldered motherboard should be.

1 - Ensure that TMC2660 Driver BOBs, Dynamixels regulators, or any other peripheral IS NOT plugged in the board

2 - Apply 20V, BE CAREFUL ABOUT POLARITY, there is no protection on this board as it is supposed to be used in application with other protections.

3 - Watch Green power LED near main 5V Recom light up.

4 - Remove power and add Teensy 3.2

5 - Apply power again, 3.3V power LED should light up now

6 - Verify correct teensy 3.2 functions :
	- Blink Program
	- Verify continuity between every Teensy pin and its destination.
	- Test current amp reading : analogRead(22); value should be close to 0. (in effect around 25mA max)

6 - If everything is working in order, turn off power, and add Teensy 3.6 alone, verify it boots and blinks.

7 - Verify continuity for all Teensy pins using the same method as for teensy 3.2.

8 - Add Teensy 3.2, verify both work at the same time and blink, then try to send UART commands between both Teensy boards.

Next step is to test individual functionalities:

9 - Add in the 7.5V regulator and check 7.5V flows correctly to all outputs
	- Test pump outputs
	- Measure correct voltage and polarity of dynamixel connectors, ensure they have been soldered the right way around.

10 - Test all 6 VL53 Output, individually first, and then test 2 or 3 combinations with readressing with only 2 sensors.

11 - Test optional I2C outputs using any I2C sensor on hand (VLX53 included).

12 - Individually test out all line QTR inputs.

13 - Test all Servo outputs individually and then test two combinations with two servos

14 - Test TMC2660 drivers BOBs :
	- Individually
	- All three at the same time
	- Start testing and refining movement on robot

Last test is to test board interfaces :

15 - First test voltage on all pins of IDC output connectors

16 - If boards on hand, and tested, then try to communicate with them, otherwise, hook up the IDC socket to an arduino and do an echo test.

Last functionnality is Dynamixel servo communication.

17 - Try to communicate with on or more XL320 servos.
